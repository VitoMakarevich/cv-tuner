## Rules & Guidelines

**Purpose of a Cover Letter:**  
A cover letter is a professional introduction, complementing your resume. Unlike a resume, it allows creativity, personal branding, and the opportunity to demonstrate understanding of the company’s mission, values, and the role.

**Tailoring:**  
- Research the company and role.  
- Show alignment between your skills, experience, and the company’s goals.  
- Avoid generic letters; make each one specific and deliberate.

**Structure for Maximum Impact:**  
1. **Hook & Attention Grabber:** Open with a compelling reason why you are an ideal candidate. Personal anecdotes or motivation are acceptable if relevant.  
2. **Value Proposition:** Clearly articulate what you bring to the role and how it contributes to the company’s mission.  
3. **Achievements & Impact:** Highlight concrete successes, measurable results, and collaborative experiences.  
4. **Motivation & Fit:** Explain why this company and role resonate with your values, aspirations, or career trajectory.  
5. **Concise & Polished:** Keep it under one page. Proofread meticulously to avoid grammar or spelling mistakes.

**Pitfalls to Avoid:**  
- **Generic Letters:** Avoid one-size-fits-all content.  
- **Repetition:** Do not duplicate your resume; highlight context and impact instead.  
- **Over-verbosity:** Stay concise and clear.  
- **Sloppiness:** Proofread carefully; attention to detail matters.
