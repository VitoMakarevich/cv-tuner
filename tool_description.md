# CV Optimization Tool

It's time to make your CV perfect.  
The rules are simple: your CV will almost certainly be checked—and possibly rejected—by AI tools.

## Security
Credentials you provide are **not stored** by the app owner.  
You are encouraged to review the [source code](https://github.com/VitoMakarevich/cv-tuner) or [clone and run it locally](https://github.com/VitoMakarevich/cv-tuner).  

Since the app runs on a server, uploaded PDFs are temporarily stored. They are scheduled for deletion **after 1 hour**.  
**Important:** It is unknown how long this information may be retained on OpenAI servers.

## Usage
**Use at your own risk.**  
Currently, the tool does not produce any side effects or metadata, so the CV cannot be flagged as AI-generated.

## System Prompt
You have full control over CV generation. Focus on the following rules:

1. **Match Tightness** – Remove knowledge you don’t want to highlight or add skills you possess but haven’t included.  
   **Recommendation:** Fill in the basics and avoid adding skills you cannot learn quickly.

2. **Additional Skills** – Decide whether to remove some knowledge and highlight only the required skills to avoid being treated as a [jack of all trades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_of_all_trades).

3. **Tone Adjustment** – Tailor the tone of your CV to match the job description:  
   - **Big tech companies:** emphasize passion, seniority, and leadership.  
   - **Smaller companies:** highlight reliability and interest in a standard 9-to-5 role.

4. **Buzzwords** – Frequently repeat relevant buzzwords close to the original phrasing to achieve a high match rate.  
   *(For context: to some AI tools or people, “string theory” and “IntelliJ IDEA” might sound equally complex.)*

5. **English** – Ensure clear and standard English. Avoid internet slang or regional variations that may be easily detected.

The rest is minor and can be extended as needed.

## Job Description
Copy and paste the job description exactly as it appears.

## Experience
Include all your past experience, covering everything you have used and are eager to use in the future. Semi-structured formatting is acceptable.
